A stricken tanker that had spilled some 170,000 gallons of diesel 
into the waters off the Galapagos Islands has dumped its remaining 
fuel into this fragile marine environment. An estimated 15,000 to 
20,000 gallons of additional fuel was spilled late Tuesday, apparently 
after pounding surf caused new breaks in the hull of the tanker Jessica, 
officials said. How much of an environmental setback the additional 
spill represented was not immediately clear. Officials scattered dispersants 
and established a perimeter of floating containment buoys. ``We have 
taken all precautions to confront this situation,'' said Eliecer Cruz, 
director of the Galapagos National Park. The Jessica, which ran aground 
Jan. 16 with about 243,000 gallons of fuel, was listing sharply to 
its right in shallow waters about 550 yards from San Cristobal Island, 
the easternmost island in the archipelago. Some 35 workers were in 
small motor boats late Tuesday, trying to skim the rolling tidal waters 
to retrieve as much of the spilled fuel as possible, Cruz said. A 
team of pollution-control experts from the U.S. Coast Guard arrived 
Sunday and helped recover about 10,000 gallons of fuel from the tanker. 
But pounding surf prompted suspension of recovery operations after 
a giant wave washed over the Jessica's bow, injuring the tanker's 
captain and bruising several Ecuadorean recovery workers. The U.S. 
Coast Guard team was still on the island Wednesday and planned to 
remain, probably until next Tuesday, to offer assistance and technical 
advice, said spokesman Lt. Shawn Tripp from the U.S. Coast Guard air 
station in Clearwater, Fla. Slicks from last week's diesel spill had 
spread to fill an area bigger than Los Angeles. Earlier Tuesday, it 
had appeared that nature was providing a helping hand for the islands 
_ an ecosystem populated by species found nowhere else in the world 
and an inspiration for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution. Ecuadorean 
Environment Minister Rodolfo Rendon said that fortuitous winds and 
strong currents had shifted the direction of the spilled diesel to 
the northwest, where there are no major islands. He said the spill, 
which officials have blamed on navigational error, was ``a problem, 
not a tragedy.'' The Galapagos, 600 miles west of the Ecuadorean mainland, 
is that country's main tourist attraction. Despite the wind shift, 
the spill here has taken a toll on the chain's unique wildlife. Oil 
reached Santa Fe Island, 37 miles west of San Cristobal, the easternmost 
island in the Galapagos archipelago and home to large colonies of 
sea lions and marine iguanas. Rendon said one pelican had died and 
that the fuel had harmed some 40 other animals, including sea lions, 
seagulls, blue-footed boobies and albatrosses, which had been rescued 
and cleaned. Robert Bensted-Smith, director of the Charles Darwin 
Research Station, said that long-term damage was still being assessed. 
He said that beside the strong currents pushing the fuel out to sea, 
strong sunshine had helped evaporate some of the oil. But, he said, 
there was evidence that an undetermined quantity of sea urchins and 
seaweed had died on San Cristobal. One long-term threat is that the 
escaped fuel will sink to the ocean floor, destroying algae that is 
vital to the food chain. That could threaten marine iguanas, sharks, 
birds that feed off fish and other species, officials say. Ecuador 
declared a state of emergency late Monday to speed up funding for 
the cleanup.

The Captain of the stricken tanker off the Galapagos Islands has had 
a nervous breakdown. He was due to face the press after hearing that 
he was being prosecuted by the Ecuadorian authorities after 250,000 
gallons of oil were spilled into the sea near the Islands. Tim Hersche 
reports. Captain Tokinio Arivalo has already admitted that his navigational 
mistake steering the Jessica into harbor on the island of San Kristobal 
caused the spill, which has threatened the unique wild life of the 
Galapagos. He was due to face the world press at a news conference, 
but shortly before he was said to have suffered a nervous collapse 
and he is now being treated at a Naval Hospital on the island. Meanwhile, 
two tugboats are in the harbor attempting to attach cables to the 
stricken vessel so that she can be pulled upright and prepared for 
floating off the rocks. A United States coast guard spokesman has 
said it's an operation which could take several days. Tim Hersche,

Want another advantage of hydrogen over oil? Well, when is the last 
time you heard of a hydrogen spill threatening a sensitive ecosystem? 
Today more than a week after a tanker spilled a 180 thousand gallons 
of oil near the Galapagos Islands, experts are warning that it could 
take several days to drag the ship away. And the tanker's captain 
now faces charges that could land him up to 5 years in prison. The 
BBC's Tim Hersh reports from one of the Ecuadorian Islands. The captain 
of the Jessica Tokinio Arivalo is being held at the port authority 
building on San Kristobal which looks directly out to the stricken 
tanker still stranded on a reef after running aground nine days ago. 
Mr. Arivala said he had mistaken a channel marker at the entrance 
to the harbor for a lighthouse. He spoke of his horror as the vessel 
ran aground and he realized his mistake. In that moment I felt like 
it was right up to me to die. I know what's happening now. But that 
time I didn't know. I had nine nights, nine days, not eating nor sleeping. 
I feel sick because I don't feel guilty for that. Formal proceedings 
are now underway to prosecute Mr. Arivalo and the owners of the Jessica. 
An official from the Ecuadorian prosecuting authorities Alfrado Alvea 
arrived on the island to announce the start of legal action. The owners 
of the boat, the captain, the crew, they will send you, all the persons 
who've made that damage, up to five years to the jail and pay all 
the damage they have cost. Out in the harbor preparations are being 
made to attach cables to the tanker so that it can be floated and 
towed out to sea, where it's expected to be sunk. Edwin Stanton of 
the United States Coastguard says the rough sea conditions have helped 
to reduce the environmental damage from the oil spill. Paradoxically, 
the surf that's washing over the boat and causing damage to the vessel 
has been mixing the diesel with the heavy oil and allowing both to 
evaporate and mix into the water very well. So Mother Nature give 
us and Mother Nature take it away. No major oil concentrations have 
been sighted recently more than 6-10 miles Northwest of the source 
of the vessel. So much of it is naturally dissipating and evaporating. 
We are very lucky in that. But conservation scientists are still very 
concerned about small amounts of oil which have washed up on beaches 
up to 80 kilometers away, possibly threatening creatures, including 
Galapagos' sea turtles. Ecological disaster may have been averted, 
but the wildlife is not completely safe yet. The BBC's Tim Hersh reporting 
from the Galapagos Island of San Kristobal.

Navies from the United States, Japan, South Korea and Singapore on 
Monday began the first combined submarine rescue exercise in the Pacific. 
The 13-day Exercise Pacific Reach 2000 involves 600 people, four ships, 
four submarines and three sophisticated underwater devices that can 
rescue personnel from submarines in distress. The joint exercise in 
the South China Sea off Singapore was planned nearly two years before 
the recent Russian submarine disaster that killed 118 people, but 
participants said the disaster heightened the importance of submarine 
rescue. ``This is the first time we've really had the chance to work 
together in a regional submarine rescue exercise in the Pacific,'' 
said Lt. Leslie Hull-Ryde, a Navy spokeswoman in Singapore. The navies' 
working together will promote ``greater understanding and also a commitment 
to stability'' in the Asia-Pacific region, Hull-Ryde said. The Navy 
has begun venturing into shallower coastal waters and will use the 
exercise to test its shallow-water rescue capabilities, said Navy 
Capt. C.J. Leidig, deputy coordinator of the exercise. ``We are looking 
to operate in more shallow waters in recent years as we make the transition 
from a Cold War, blue-water navy to a more littoral (coastal) type 
strategy, so shallow water submarine rescue has become important,'' 
Leidig said. Exercise Pacific Reach is taking place in about 231 feet 
to 264 feet of water _ considered shallow for submarines _ Leidig 
told a news conference Monday. Russia, China, Britain, Australia, 
Canada, Chile and Indonesia have sent observers to this week's exercise 
230 miles northeast of Singapore. During the exercise, some of the 
submarines will sit on the bottom ``simulating disabled subs,'' Leidig 
said. Underwater rescue devices such as a Navy high-tech ``diving 
bell'' will be attached to the submarines' hatches and transfer crew 
to the rescue vehicle. Special diving suits will also be used. The 
U.S. Navy nuclear attack submarine USS Helena is taking part, along 
with submarines JDS Akishio of Japan, South Korea's ROKS Choi Moo 
Sun and Singapore's RSS Conqueror. Japan, South Korea and Singapore 
are sending rescue support ships to the exercise, while the United 
States, Japan and South Korea are sending underwater rescue vehicles. 
Japan's equivalent of a naval force is officially referred to as the 
Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. Since Japan was defeated in World 
War II and formally renounced military aggression, its armed forces 
are constitutionally limited to a self-defense role. Submarine emergencies 
grabbed world attention in August when Russia's Kursk nuclear submarine 
sank after an explosion. Russian officials, including President Vladimir 
Putin, were criticized for slow and awkward handling of the incident.

The Norwegian subsidiary of a U.S. firm run until recently by Dick 
Cheney will help recover the remains of the 118 seamen who died in 
the sinking of the Russian nuclear submarine Kursk. The contract for 
the retrieval operations was awarded Monday to the Tananger, Norway 
branch of Halliburton Co., the Dallas-based oil services firm. Cheney 
was Halliburton's chief executive from 1995 until August, when he 
resigned to become the GOP vice presidential nominee. Representatives 
of the company's Tananger branch signed the contract Monday with the 
Rubin military design bureau, which designed the Kursk. Igor Spassky, 
the head of Rubin, told a news conference in St. Petersburg that the 
retrieval work would begin about Oct. 18. He said it would be impossible 
to bring back all the remains, since most of the compartments in the 
shattered submarine were destroyed in the Aug. 12 disaster. ``We expect 
that we'll be able to retrieve 20 to 30 percent of the crew in this 
operation, which would be a very good result,'' Spassky said. ``The 
rest we will have to bury after we raise the sub itself.'' Neither 
side would say how much the contract is worth, though Rubin had reportedly 
offered $9 million to another Norwegian company, Stolt Offshore, to 
take part in the operation. That deal fell through. Authorities still 
have not determined what caused the explosions and sinking of the 
Kursk, which went down during military exercises. Russian officials 
say the most likely scenario was a collision with a foreign submarine. 
But the United States, which has acknowledged that its submarines 
were monitoring the military exercises, has denied that. American 
officials say the Kursk may have gone down after a torpedo misfire.

Two months ago, the Kursk, a Russian nuclear submarine went down in 
the Barents sea during military exercises. All 118 sailors died. American 
officials say the Kursk may have sunk after a torpedo misfire but 
Moscow authorities are still investigating. Many Russian people are 
skeptical about the inquiry and about the wisdom of trying to recover 
the remains of the seamen, an operation said to begin in about 2 weeks. 
The World's Nenad Chebeck reports from Moscow. The tragedy of the 
Kursk submarine has disappeared from the front pages but is anything 
but forgotten in Russia. Last month, in accordance with Russian orthodox 
tradition, a remembrance class was held 40 days after the death of 
118 seamen aboard the Kursk. All over the country bearded priests 
spread out a roll call of the crewmembers. But even the clouds of 
incense could not hide the two main controversies following the accident 
- what caused it and what to do with the submarine and the bodies 
of the crew. President Vladimir Putin promised the families that the 
bodies will be recovered and Sir Gay Evanell, the Head of the powerful 
Security Council says the promise still stands. We are going to see 
through this unique operation. No one has ever done anything like 
it before. And we do realize that it is very risky, both when it comes 
to physical dangers for the divers, and to the psychological stress 
depending on what we find there. But not everyone thinks recovering 
the bodies is a good idea. Naval captain Biltera Pedro says it's against 
tradition that sailors have respected for centuries and could also 
cause great grief. He says, "Just imagine the tragedy of those families 
when some bodies are retrieved and others aren't." Russia had a similar 
case way back in 1970s says Pedro, when just one body was recovered. 
The Fleet Commander then decided to have even that one body handed 
back to the sea where the submarine went down says Pedro. And it's 
not just about the tradition in the past, but the future as well argues 
Alexe Budnev from the Veterans Club of the Russian Fleet. The cost 
of this operation will be huge. I think it would be much better to 
invest the sum in improving the rescue capabilities of the Russian 
fleet, so we can save lives in the future. And while this controversy 
going on, so does the government investigation to the causes of the 
disaster. Former submarine captain Ureg Gladkovich says that he is 
confident the government commission will do a good job. The authorities 
need to know the truth in order to make whatever changes are necessary 
for the future safety of the submarine fleet says Gladkovich. But 
whether those findings will ever reach the public is another matter. 
Just look back at the way they fudged and lied their way through the 
rescue operation. They never gave us the full truth. That gives us 
reason to doubt their good intentions to tell us the truth this time. 
It all depends on the good will of the military and the government. 
Unfortunately, Russia doesn't have a political mechanism that would 
make such an investigation open to the public. Military affairs analysts 
with the well-respected Russian news magazine Itogi, Alexander Gulls, 
says the Commission's work is just a smoke screen. He says the cause 
of the Kursk tragedy is known to those in charge. Our Navy Commanders 
they know pretty well and all that's going on now points that these 
people want to hide the real thing that had had happened onboard of 
Kursk. But what did cause the Kursk tragedy? There are three main 
theories. Firstly, that a torpedo missile misfired while still in 
the tube causing a massive explosion in the armory. Secondly, that 
the sub hit a mine leftover from World War II. And thirdly, a collision 
with another vessel. Former captain Ureg Gladkovich says that his 
experience leads into believing another theory. I believe that the 
Captain over the Kursk took a sudden and drastic maneuver to avoid 
colliding with another vessel. The waters were shallow for such a 
huge submarine and the sub maneuver led to the front part of the sub 
hitting the seabed with great speed. The shear force led to the explosion 
of the armaments that are stored in the front compartment. The whole 
front part of the submarine was probably flooded within seconds killing 
most of the crew says Gladkovich. The ones in the back compartments 
could have survived for a while, he says, but not more than a few 
hours, as the sea continued to flood the whole boat after it cracked 
up. But while the theory sounds very closable, there is no evidence 
as yet to make it anything more than educated guess work According 
to military analyst, Alexander Gulls, that is the way things will 
remain. The huge money that were promised to families avail, receive 
ten times more than families of soldiers who were killed in Chechnya. 
For me, it's rather cynical attempt to shut them up. With so many 
secrets linked to the Kursk, Russia's most advanced nuclear submarine, 
the full truth may never emerge, even if the bodies and the boat eventually 
do. For The World this is Nenad Sebek in Moscow.

A team of Russian divers has flown to Norway to prepare for recovery 
of bodies from the downed Kursk nuclear submarine. The fifteen divers 
left St. Petersburg Sunday for the Norwegian port of Bergen, the base 
for the special recovery mission. The operation set to begin October 
18th is being led by Moscow and a Norwegian subsidiary of the US Oil 
Company, Haliberton. Russian authorities have yet to determine what 
caused the Kursk, one of the military's newest submarines to go down. 
The entire 118 men crew of the massive sub was killed when it plunged 
to the bottom of the Barents Sea last August.

the barents sea. the cause of the disaster has not been determined. 
an international salvage team is due to arrive at the scene of the

economic issues are the theme of the day on the campaign trail. democratic 
presidential nominee al gore spoke to business leaders in manhattan. 
he pointed out the nation's current prosperity and outlined his differences 
with republican rival george w. bush. gore says the speech is a chance 
to set the stage for the home stretch of the election when undecided 
voters are making up their minds. while george w. bush is arguing 
the current administration can't take any credit for the nation's 
economic good times. during a campaign stop in fraser, michigan today, 
bush said it's productive people, not politicians, who are behind 
the enormous growth of recent years.

On October 12th hundreds of musicians, artists, writers and other 
Appalachian Mountain folk will congregate in North Tennessee 25 kms 
north of Knoxville for the 21st annual Tennessee fall homecoming. 
The event promises four days of mountain activities including sheep 
and duck herding, buck dancing and clogging, coal baking and wood 
carving and, of course, music. All of the events take place at the 
museum of Appalachia a 23-hectare complex. VOA's Susan Roll toured 
last spring with its founder John Rice Erwin. I had always had an 
interest in older people of the community. I thought they were the 
greatest, most wonderful, colorful people that I could imagine. So 
if you know people like that it's just really natural information 
they want to have something that belong to them you know. The rocking 
chair that the old lady sitting for all her life or the warm acts 
or the piece of furniture. So that was one of the reason I started 
collecting things. Now 70 years old John Rice Erwin began his collection 
a little over 30 years ago. It soon spread from axes and furniture 
to buildings, a log church and school house as well as several cabins 
and farm buildings, which he moved to his sprawling backyard in the 
hills of Eastern Tennessee. Not far from where he grew up. As a boy 
Mr. Erwin liked to listen to the stories his grandparents told him 
and as he grew older he became concerned that the history of the region 
was being lost. One of the things that I had noticed was that so many 
of the restorations, for example the log houses, had items there that 
belonged to the 17,000s you know the front lock raffles and so forth. 
And then they had items such as a Victorian pump organ sitting next 
to it and didn't make any much sense. And I thought it would be nice 
to have a log cabin from the area whose history I knew and to have 
something about the people who live there and who had built it, and 
who mended it and kept it, passed it on and to furnish it in the way 
it should be. That first cabin opened to the public in the late 1960s. 
Museum founder John Rice Erwin furnished the cabin with a table, bed, 
blanket chest, bench, cradle, simple wooden chairs, a high chair for 
an infant, and an unusual gadget with strips of cloth dangling from 
it over the dinner table. This is a flash view. The head of the table 
could sit here and treadle this old contraption and swing those pieces 
of cloth back and forth across the table keeping all the flies out. 
This is a large cabin. This belonged to an old gentleman by the name 
of General Bunch and he was one of 12 children. When this old gentleman 
was a youngster he drove a team of oxen to drag the logs in and help 
build it and after everybody had moved out of that area the coal company 
bought all the land and well the coal company let me move it. So I 
have furnished it in pioneer-type thing. You are seeing here one of 
my hens is laying eggs in that big basket. Those are real eggs? Those 
are fresh? Yeah. Oh wow. I need to put out some straw in there so 
that they won't roll around. She will hatch out little chicks, you 
know. Chicken, sheep and goats roam the grounds of the museum of Appalachia. 
There are also cattle, horses and mules and a garden filled with vegetables 
like spinach, cabbage, onions and potatoes, as well as an orchard 
of various fruit trees. Founder John Rice Erwin says he hopes some 
visitors are inspired to experiment with pioneer life in some small 
way after they tour the museum of Appalachia. Some people assume that 
just because I'm interested in all these earlier kinds of activities 
and buildings and all, that I would encourage everybody to go back 
to this lifestyle, you know, which is ridiculous. But what I would 
hope that and I think it's possible for people, no matter how sophisticated 
they are in the present day, they could do this on the side. People 
could learn to raise vegetable gardens, we have great food and it's 
the greatest therapy in the world. I thank a psychiatrist would go 
out of business if everybody had a garden to go out and look at every 
morning, see how much it's grown or not. Making music is another type 
of therapy John Rice Erwin practices. He plays mandolin, guitar and 
harmonica and occasionally sits in with the band that performs everyday 
at the museum of Appalachia. I'm Susan Lowe.
